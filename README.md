# ITE1806-Data-Communication-&-Security
This is a project purpose only. 
The ITE1806 is divided in two, the Data Communication part where the student learns different types of protocols, such as TCP, IP, UDP, ICMP, SMTP, HTTP and so on. The basic of WLAN and Ethernet. As well as learning about GNS3 and Wireshark application and how to use these as a tool in the future. 

The other part of this course is learning about Security, the basic principle and configuration of firewall, security mechanism, encryption and decryption, signature, public and private key. How to protect from threats, handling different types of attack and so on.

I will be using GIT and Github as I work through with this course.
